// ------------------- How To Run The Program -------------------
	Requirements: 
		- 	All included .cc files
		- 	All included .h files
		- 	Included makefile
		
	Execution:
			Compiling:
		- 	Run the makefile using 'make' command or 'make all' command.
		- 	For running just the tests use the 'make tests' command.
			
			After compiling:
		-	To run the test_vector executable use the './test_vector' command.
		- 	To run the test_scalar executable use the './test_scalar' command.
		-	To run the vecalc executable use the './vecalc' command.
		
			Clean Up:
		- 	To clean up the directory of all .o files and executables
			run the 'make clean' command.
			
// ------------------- The Code -------------------
	vector.h
		This file contains all the definitions needed for vector.cc and many
		of the other .cc files. The definitions contained within are 
		alloc_vec(), dealloc_vec(), extend_vec(), and print_vec(). The
		definitions for Elem, Vector, and the constant MAX_ELEMS are all
		defined here. 'stdint.h' is included at the top just so the program will 
		compile properly on Linux systems. This line is not needed on Mac OSX.
		
	vector.cc
		This file contains all the implementations for alloc_vec(),
		dealloc_vec(), extend_vec(), and print_vec(). 
		
		alloc_vec()
			Allocates a new vector.
		dealloc_vec()
			Deallocates the given vector.
		extend_vec()
			Appends a new vector to the previous one.
		print_vec()
			Prints the given vector out.
			
	scalar.h
		This file contains the definitions for the scalar operations. The 
		definitions contained within are scalar_plus(), scalar_minus(), 
		scalar_mult, scalar_div(). The 'vector.h' header is included in 
		order to use the Vector struct.
