// ------------------- How To Run The Program -------------------
	Requirements: 
		- 	The "version_buddy" script file.
		-	The script was created and tested on macOS.
		
	Execution:
		- 	Run the "version_buddy" script using './version_buddy' or
			'sh version_buddy'
		-	Can take only one argument which is a filename with the format
			'name_major_minor.ext'.
		- 	ex:
			./version_buddy <filename>
			
		
			
// -------------------------- The Code --------------------------
	The script starts by checking if it was passed exactly one argument.
	If it was not then it returns an appropriate error message. It then
	goes on to check to see if an option was accidentally provided, if it
	was it returns an appropriate error message. It then proceeds to check
	if the argument is a file, then if the file is in the current directory,
	then if the file name has the proper format, and finally if the output
	file already exits. If all these tests are passed then the file name is
	converted and a string displaying such is displayed on the console. If
	any of the aforementioned tests fail then the appropriate error message
	is displayed on the console.
