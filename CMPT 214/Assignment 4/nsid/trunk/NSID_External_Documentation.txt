// ------------------- How To Run The Program -------------------
	Requirements: 
		- 	The "nsid" script file.
		-	The script was created and tested on macOS.
		
	Execution:
		- 	Run the "nsid" script using './nsid' or sh nsid
		-	Can take one or more arugments or can be piped, redirected, etc.
		- 	ex:
			./nsid <argument>
			./nsid <argument1> <argument2>
			cat 'file' | sh nsid 
			sh nsid < 'file'
			sh nsid <<< 'string'
		
			
// -------------------------- The Code --------------------------
	This file contains a function calle is_nsid(). This function checks
	to see if the passed argument matches the designated NSID pattern.
	The rest of the code checks to see if an argument or something from stdin
	is being passed to the script. is_nsid() is then called and checks the 
	value that was passed and returns 0 if the value is a match or 1 if it is
	not. The appropriate output is displayed according to whether or not the 
	passed value was a match.
