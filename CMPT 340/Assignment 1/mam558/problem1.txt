These were answered assuming these functions took in integers as it was not
specified in the assignment outline.

a)  swap :: (Integer, Integer) -> (Integer, Integer)
    swap (x, y) = (y, x)

b)  pair :: Integer -> Integer -> (Integer, Integer)
    pair x y = (x, y)

c)  double :: Integer -> Integer
    double x = x*2

d)  twice :: Integer -> (Integer -> (Integer))
    twice f x = f (f (x))
