PartC.testplan.txt

1) Testing Inputs for all functions.
	At this point they are all printing to the console, to 
	confirm that they are hitting the conditional.	

2) Testing different ways to add and remove items from a lists. 
	This is seen by the numbers of "size" that are changing 	
	throughout the test output, after adding or removing.

3) This also makes sure that when a list or node is placed 
	back on the empty list/node list, it does infact arive
	at the intended destination. This is shown in the 
	conditional that will print out a message if the location
	of the expected item is ether missing or NULL.

4) Testing the removals when there are from no elements to more than 1
	

5) Test the search function 
	On the the first element, last element, and on an element thats 
	not in the list.

6) Testing that there is a correct allocation of a new list.
	printing a message out at the end of the error message seen at 
	the top of the testing output.
