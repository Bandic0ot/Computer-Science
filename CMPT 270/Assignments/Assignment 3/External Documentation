The only thing needed to compile the classes are the .class and .java files.
Each class contains it's own main method for testing the functions of the class.
The classes were created and tested in Eclipse Neon.

Every method is working. Each method has been tested for thoroughly and assuming 
the proper input is entered each method performs as per the specifications of 
the assignment outline. This is with the exception of the FlightReservationSystem class,
which was not completed. It is a skeleton of the complete class.
