1)  'id' is the only possible candidate key.

2)  If we didn't use a surrogate key I would use the 'student_id' as a primary
    key. I would choose 'student_id' as the primary key because we can assume
    that student IDs are unique to a student and we shouldn't see repetition
    within the table.

3)  a)
      We could use a CHECK statement when creating the table to check if the
      value is one of the four valid possibilities.

      We could create a domain and then check that the value is valid within
      the newly created domain.

    b)
      -------- Using a check statement --------

      CREATE TABLE students (
        gender CHAR NOT NULL CHECK (gender IN ('M', 'F', 'U', 'N'))
      );

      -------- Using a domain --------

      CREATE DOMAIN genderType AS CHAR (
        CHECK (VALUE IN ('M', 'F', 'U', 'N'))
      );

      CREATE TABLE students (
        gender genderType NOT NULL
      );

4)    We should use a 'CREATE ASSERTION' to make sure this doesn't happen.

      CREATE ASSERTION enforce_max_enroll (
        CHECK (NOT EXISTS (SELECT num_enrolled FROM sections GROUP BY num_enrolled HAVING COUNT(max_enrolled) > num_enrolled))
      );
