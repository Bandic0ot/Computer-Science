	Using two diffent computers, signed into tuxworld, we will make sure that 
everything is running smoothly. 

	This will involve sending special charictors 
such as ", *, &, \n, ., $, ect. to ensure that these do not perform in an 
undesired way.  

	We will also send two messages at the same time (within human error), to 
confirm that there is no deadlock that can be enabled.

	As there are few boundry cases, comunicating a sentence such as:

		Hello, \n $(this) is a 't*st' of the "functionality" & is gr8. Eh.

	testing functionallity/correctness.

	- 	8 correspondences btween computers
	- 	repeated quickly successive outputs
	- 	a copied and pasted words consisting of multiple return statements
	- 	input a file on both computers, at the same time. Confirm content 
		remains together
