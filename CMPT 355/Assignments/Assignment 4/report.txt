1.  When creating the employee_history table I thought it would be a good idea to
    add an employee_number column, an employee_id column, and a history_timestamp
    column. The timestamp gives us insight as to what the most recent changes were,
    while the employee_number/id columns give us possibly more flexibility when
    viewing the employee history. (Perhaps the company does not reuse employee numbers
    or IDs so it would be a good idea to be able to view them should an employee get
    deleted from the live database.)

2.  I decided to use AFTER triggers for all of the triggers because I wanted the
    changes to take place before inserting into the audit/history tables. In other
    words I wanted the newest changes on the employee stored, not the old values.

3.  The biggest issue I ran into was dividing the phone numbers into the correct
    columns for for the report view. There was also a problem with loading phone
    numbers that weren't in the correct format (ie. too long), so I added a check
    in the phone loading procedure which skips the record and raises a notice.


General Comments

I noticed there was a typo in the busCountry column (busCoutry), not sure if this
was intentional. In a real world scenario I'd probably contact the company to see
if this could be corrected.

Notes

Within load_procedures.sql all the changes I made are marked with
/* Assignment 4 load procedure modifications. */ using text find should be
the quickest way to see my changes.

Dates were formatted during CSV export since they were already of type date
within the database. Otherwise would have used TO_DATE(date, 'yyyy-mm-dd').
