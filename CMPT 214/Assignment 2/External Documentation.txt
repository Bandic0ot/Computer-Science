The vecalc.cc is completely functional within the guidelines of the assignment 
outline. All tests are completed. All testing is done within the
#ifdef TESTING block. The only errors that should be output when compiled are
errors about unused parameters from the stub routines of scalar_minus(),
scalar_mult() and scalar_div().
