Style Violations

1.	Inconsistent use of whitespacing, throughout the entire file. Mainly within/between
	brackets. Eg. Lines 17 and 20. There is a space in between the two closing brackets
	on line 17, but not on 20.

2.	Inconsistent placement of brackets. The same style is not followed throughout the 
	file.

3.	Obscure variable names of the two integers on lines 4 and 5.

4.	Redundant comment on line 13.

5.	Inaccurate comment on line 8.

6.	Comment starting on line 26 could perhaps be cleaned up and reordered.

7. 	Comment is not descriptive enough on line 31.
