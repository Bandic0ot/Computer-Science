// ------------------- How To Run The Program -------------------
	Requirements: 
		- 	All included .cc files
		- 	All included .h files
		- 	Included makefile
		
	Execution:
			Compiling:
		- 	Run the makefile using 'make' command or 'make all' command.
		- 	For running just the tests use the 'make tests' command.
			
			After compiling:
		-	To run the test_vector executable use the './test_vector' command.
		- 	To run the test_scalar executable use the './test_scalar' command.
		-	To run the vecalc executable use the './vecalc' command.
		
			Clean Up:
		- 	To clean up the directory of all .o files and executables
			run the 'make clean' command.
			
// ------------------- The Code -------------------
	vector.h
		This file contains all the definitions needed for vector.cc and many
		of the other .cc files. The definitions contained within are 
		alloc_vec(), dealloc_vec(), extend_vec(), and print_vec(). The
		definitions for Elem, Vector, and the constant MAX_ELEMS are all
		defined here. 'stdint.h' is included at the top just so the program 
		will compile properly on Linux systems. This line is not needed on 
		Mac OSX.
		
	vector.cc
		This file contains all the implementations for alloc_vec(),
		dealloc_vec(), extend_vec(), and print_vec(). 
		
		alloc_vec()
			Allocates a new vector.
		dealloc_vec()
			Deallocates the given vector.
		extend_vec()
			Appends a new vector to the previous one.
		print_vec()
			Prints the given vector out.
			
	scalar.h
		This file contains the definitions for the scalar operations. The 
		definitions contained within are scalar_plus(), scalar_minus(), 
		scalar_mult, scalar_div(). The 'vector.h' header is included in 
		order to use the Vector struct.
		
	scalar.cc
		This file contains all the implementations for scalar_plus(), 
		scalar_minus(), scalar_mult, scalar_div().
		
		scalar_plus()
			Adds the given scalar to each vector element.
		scalar_minus()
			Subtracts the scalar from each vector element.
		scalar_mult()
			Multiplies each vector element by the given scalar.
		scalar_div()
			Divides each vector element by the given scalar.
			
	test_vector.cc
		This file contains methods for testing the functions contained 
		within vector.cc. The functions are test_alloc(), test_dealloc(),
		test_extend(), and test_print(). Vectors v1-5 are test variables
		used to test the functions. 'assert()' is used throughout the
		file to test whether or not the proper outputs are obtained from
		the test functions.
		
		test_alloc()
			Tests the alloc_vec() method.
		test_dealloc()
			This method simply deallocate the given vectors. There is no
			way of actually testing properly right now.
		test_extend()
			Tests the extend_vec() method.
		test_print()
			Tests the print_vec() method.
			
	test_scalar.cc
		This file contains methods for testing the functions contained
		within scalar.cc. The functions are test_scalarPlus(),
		test_scalarMinus, test_scalarMult(), and test_scalarDiv(). 'assert()'
		is used throughout the file to test whether or not the proper outputs
		are obtained from the test functions.
		
		test_scalarPlus()
			Tests the scalar_plus() method.
		test_scalarMinus()
			Tests the scalar_minus() method.
		test_scalarMult()
			Tests the scalar_mult() method.
		test_scalarDiv()
			Tests the scalar_div() method.
