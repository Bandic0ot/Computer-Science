As part A is not complete, file system performance tests can not
be executed by the code. but, this will descuss the plan to test.


the variables that would have individually been changed, would be:
- the total amount of disk space. reducing it to fewer blocks than possible files.
- the number of threads acting on the system at once (average)
- number of files, the average number in the system.
- the frequency of thread requests.(sleeps for longer)
- number of inodes available

this would be done by changing environment variables within the file.

while recording values for:
- average thread wait time (shorter the better)
- average thread execution time. (shorter the better)
- the number of times a file was successfully added and removed
- total disk space (a constant)
- average size of all files (a constant)
- average # of threads executing at once. (higher the better)
- length of threads sleeping
- average # of files in the system. (higher the better)
- number of inodes available. (a constant)

a constant would be changed a couple of times t view the fluxuations 
by the other variables.(eg. small disk space, large file size, effect on wait times)

the compleation of these tests would show when graphed the point that increasing
disk size no longer significantly increases execution time.
