1)  'id' is the only possible candidate key, because it is the only column with
    unique values.

    If we didn't use a surrogate key I would use the 'student_id' as a primary
    key. I would choose 'student_id' as the primary key because we can assume
    that student IDs are unique to a student and we shouldn't see repetition
    within the column.

2)  a)
      We could use a CHECK statement when creating the table to check if the
      value is one of the four valid possibilities.

      We could create a domain and then check that the value is valid within
      the newly created domain.

    b)
      -------- Using a check statement --------

      CREATE TABLE students (
        gender CHAR NOT NULL
        CHECK (gender IN ('M', 'F', 'U', 'N'))
      );

      -------- Using a domain --------

      CREATE DOMAIN genderType AS CHAR
      CHECK (VALUE IN ('M', 'F', 'U', 'N'));

      CREATE TABLE students (
        gender genderType NOT NULL
      );

3)    We could alter the table and a check to make sure the number of
      enrolled students is less than the maximum enrollment to ensure
      we don't get an over-filled class.

      ALTER TABLE sections
      ADD CONSTRAINT enforce_max_enroll
      CHECK (num_enrolled < max_enrollment);
