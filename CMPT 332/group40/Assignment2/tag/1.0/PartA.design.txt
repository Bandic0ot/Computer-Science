thread_create()
	- Essentially a modified fork. The fork creates a new process,
allocating the page table, kernel stack, state, etc. the same way it would
for any normal process. We modify the function so that the return instruction
pointer from the trap frame points to the entry point 'tmain'. Then we take
the stack that was passed in as an argument and set the stack pointer to point
to the base address given by 'stack' plus some arbitrary size which gives us
the top of the stack. From here we move the stack pointer down by 4 bytes and
push the 'arg' passed in to thread_create onto the stack. (4 bytes because
that's the size of void pointer) Again we subtract 4 bytes and set the
return address of the stack to 0xFFFFFFFF, the new top of the stack and where
the stack will resume next time something is put on it.

thread_join()
	- Wait for a single child thread to terminate.
