Review

When creating the new design for the database for Assignment 3, I decided to
break out the Country, Province, City and Address Types tables. I chose to do
this because while it technically would have got the job done leaving these tables
as attributes in the 'Addresses' table, it would have presented the problem of
deletion anomalies. I also decided to do away with the 'Salaries' table because
the 'Employee_Jobs' table was a good fit for this kind of info. I also wanted to
avoid circular relationships, that's why I included a 'Managers' table.

In regards to issues loading tables into the database...

There were a couple instances of characters within the flat files which weren't
enabling me to actually load the files into load tables. I manually went back
and change the characters to letters. eg. Trois-Rivieres. In a real world scenario
I would have checked with the supplier of the file to get the correct input instead
of blindly guessing what the proper spelling should be.

Another problem I found was there were two employees with the same ID, 100171. I
found there was no employee with ID 100479 so I moved one of the repeating employees
to the free ID. Again this is something that would have to be checked with the
supplier of the files because we don't know how they have this implemented in
their systems and this change could screw up their stuff.

It also appears that the postal codes for two separate Calgary locations were the
same, once again something the supplier would need to be contacted about.

Another difficulty I ran into was the conversion of a column header to a type.
For example, extracting an address type from the busStreet vs homeStreet headings.
