Problem Abstract: Get data packet from moving node to base station.

Requirements: - 1000 x 1000 area
              - nodes start at random location
              - nodes move distance D in random direction once per second
                (must "bounce" if out of area bounds)
              - logger process acts as base station
              - nodes open TCP connection to logger once per second (send ID, port, location)
              - logger sends back message telling whether or not node is in range
                - if it is, node transmits packets it has buffered
                - if it doesn't, node sends message to logger asking for info from other nodes within 
                  range of itself, repeats until there it exhausts the list
                    - if another node is found create connection, send/receive packets, close connection

I started by breaking the requirements down into components:
Node:
  - data
  - listening port
  - location
  - movement distance

Logger:
  - transmission range
  - # of sensor nodes
  - sensor node buffer

Pseudocode for single cycle of communication between node and logger
/* transmit() {
 * create_connection(logger)
 * send(id, port, location)
 * 
 * if(recv == in_range)
 *    send(data)
 * else
 *    while(recv(node) != no_nodes_left)
 *        create_connection(node)
 *        recv(location)
 *        if(location == closer)
 *            send(data)
 *        else
 *            send(nvm)
 *            close_connection(node)
 * close_connection(logger)
